# jLibLXC
Java/JVM bindings for liblxc

About
----
PROJECT IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND MOSTLY EXPERIMENTAL!

This project aims to deliver good, documented bindings and documentation for liblxc

Building
-----
Compile using SBT with `sbt compile`. Debbuging can be done with `sbt console`

Distribution
----
At this moment this project won't run as library due to lack of native loading from jar. You'll need to wait or do it by yourself. As I said, it's early 
development.
